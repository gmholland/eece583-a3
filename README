The partitioner for this assignment is implemented in Python using
the Tkinter framework. It has been developed on Linux and requires
Python 3.2.3 or higher and Tk 8.5. Python 3 is included in most Linux
distributions and Tkinter is part of the Python Standard Library. The
program should also run on Windows and Mac OS X assuming Python 3.2.3
or higher is available, but this has not been tested.

In order to run the program simply run the partition.py file with the 
python3 interpreter.

    python3 placer.py

This opens the GUI where benchmark files can be opened with the "Open"
button. Pressing the "Partition" button will run the partitioner on
the opened circuit.
